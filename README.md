## Open source experience

* When I was in college, I wrote Tetris based on the terminal. I didn't rely on any UI library, and I played color blocks on the screen, erased color blocks, and moved the cursor. . .
* The first project with more than 500 stars is lhttp is a websocket framework. At that time, golang basically had no very useful frameworks. .
* I like Go so I wrote a Go project webgo using canvas. .
